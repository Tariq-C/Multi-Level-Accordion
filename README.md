# Multi-Level-Accordion
## Preface
This is a revision to a JQuery Accordion created by Partick Abel for Sharepoint

The original code can be found here:
https://info.summit7systems.com/blog/how-to-create-dynamic-accordions-in-sharepoint-pages

##Purpose:
Creates an accordion using the "Header 2" style in sharepoint with a second level of an accordion using the "Header 3" style.
This is a generic accordion that can be customized for more scaling and more specific tasks


##Limitations: 
1. The Accordion takes place form the first <h2> instance until the end of the site
2. The Accordion's second level, <h3>, can only have one element use within in
3. The Accordion starts completely closed
